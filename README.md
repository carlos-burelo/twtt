# Twtt

A simple social network focused on developers with tools for the creation of educational content with a twitter-like interface for an easy transition to the platform.

## Porpose

This project was born from my curiosity about how things work behind the scenes and to create a platform big enough to challenge me when developing it, since it would force me to think about all the areas that a social network covers when it is created. , topics such as cache, response times, user experience, scalability, etc.
